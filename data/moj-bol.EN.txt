Cemeteries are closed due to the recent events
the recent weeks, the recent affairs
I look at the chains, wipe away my tears
just like you do
just like you do

The gate opens, can't believe my eyes
will things go differently
I run, your minders scream 'stop'
because your pain is better than mine,
your pain is better than mine

Only you can soothe the pain 
poor everyone else 
two limousines, one, the whole cemetery is yours
better than mine

On the streets and at home
the spirit of love emerges
two limousines, one, the whole cemetery is yours
bigger than mine

Four years ago, on the 10th of April
Maria's daughter ran straight under the wheels
Maria will not cross the gate today
because your pain is better than hers
your pain is better than hers

Józef had a father, a wife and a son
And that day the time stopped for them
Józef will not recall this day today
Your pain is better than his
Your pain is better than his

Only you can soothe the pain 
poor everyone else 
two limousines, one, the whole cemetery is yours
better than mine

On the streets and at home
the spirit of love emerges
two limousines, one, the whole cemetery is yours
better than mine

For me, don't really love cemeteries 
when my mum asks me I go there with her
I put flowers on my father's grave
Your pain is better than mine
Your pain is better than mine

What a beautiful day we have all been given today
to remember everyone who was taken
they stand on the other side and shed tears
just like you do
just like you do
just like you do
just like you do
